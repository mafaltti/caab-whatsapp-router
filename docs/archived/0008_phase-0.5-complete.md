Both branches are pushed:

- **`main`** — pushed with both commits, `production.yml` triggered
- **`develop`** — created and pushed, `staging.yml` triggered

## Manual Steps Remaining (Step 8)

You'll need to do these in the dashboards:

### 8a. Create Supabase projects

1. `caab-whatsapp-router-staging` (free tier)
2. `caab-whatsapp-router-prod` (free tier or pro)
3. Get personal access token from [supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)

### 8b. Configure GitHub secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Source |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Personal access token |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_STAGING` | Staging DB password |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_PRODUCTION` | Production DB password |
| `STAGING_PROJECT_ID` | Staging project ref from dashboard URL |
| `PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID` | Production project ref from dashboard URL |

---

Once the secrets are set, you can verify by clicking **"Run workflow"** on any of the three workflows in the GitHub Actions UI.
