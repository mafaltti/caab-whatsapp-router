Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes made in this session, then commit all staged and unstaged changes and push to the `develop` branch.

Steps:
1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` and add an entry under the appropriate section describing what was changed, added, or fixed.
2. Stage the relevant files (not `.claude/settings.local.json` or unrelated untracked files).
3. Write a concise commit message following the repository's existing style (imperative mood, short summary line, optional body explaining the "why").
4. Push to `origin/develop`.
